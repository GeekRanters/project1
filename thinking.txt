Problem: player 1 always starts the round.
Counter is set to 0 at the start of every round.
Counter is used to know when there's a draw (after 9 turns, when counter reaches 8).
Changing counter variable will have impact on "checkfordraw" functionality.

Solutions:
- use another variable used solely to determine whose round it is.
Variable can NOT be calculated based on player scores (because it doesn't factor in the ties). Variable needs to be set to 0 at start of game (Player 1 to play), be kept in localStorage, updated every time player clicks "play again" and then read again in
the startRound function.

var playerTurn value alternates between 1 and 2, to keep things neat and easily understood
whose turn it is.
